# App loading pattern
Single Page Applications (SPA's) can load content incrementally, or partially reload parts of the same page. For accessibility purposes the loading state must be conveyed to assistive technology.

This example demonstrates `role="progressbar"`, `role="status"` and `role="status"` + JavaScript. The JavaScript uses the method `innerHTML` to alter the text content within the DIV container. The behaviour we're wanting to recreate is the assistive technology repeating loading until the content has finished loading.

## `role="progressbar"`
Uses an ascending tone (in some browser and AT combinations) to convey audibly the progress. The full `progressbar` role [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_progressbar_role) and [aria authoring guide](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#progressbar) provides an example which does not appear to be consistently supported in assistive technology.

## `role="status"`
Provides audible feedback once only. Where the loading state must be conveyed repeatedly until loaded, this approach is in effective.

## `role="status"` + JavaScript
Provides audible feedback and toggles the text in the container from empty to "loading" on a 1 second interval to trigger the assistive technology to repeatedly announce loading.

Screen reader only CSS is applied to visually hide the span containing the "loading" text. The `data-toggle` attribute is used to keep track of when to hide or show the text.

```html
<span role="status" data-toggle="true" class="sr-hidden">Loading</span>
```

note. Incompatibility with FireFox will occur if FireFox is running first when JAWS begins. JAWS must be running first before starting FireFox.
> I spoke with the JAWS developer. When Firefox launches, it detects whether JAWS is running and changes its window structure. Seeing as alerts work fine no matter what launches first, JAWS will probably eventually develop a workaround but the key thing here is that real users would have launched JAWS first, so this is not as big of a bug as it might seem.
